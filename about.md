## Interests

- I am interested in Data Science and I am always looking for new developments in NLP and LLMs. 
- I like mathematics very much, so an inclination towards Machine Learning and Statistics came naturally to me.
- I was previously indulged a lot into Time Series Analysis due to its direct impact on Economics and Econometric studies.
- I also like to solve DSA problems on Leetcode when I feel like. 

## Non-academic Interests

- I have a strong liking for the sciences, including Biology and Computer Sciences. Sometimes I randomly open a Wiki article and spend my evening over it.
- I enjoy chess a lot. You can definitely intrigue me and get me started simply by mentioning the game.
- I also enjoy action video games and TV drama shows a lot. 
- I particularly enjoy the anime media as well.
- I also wish to study psychology someday.
